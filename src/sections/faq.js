        <p>This site uses Vercel for serverless functions and hosting, Next.js and React for rendering, Emotion for CSS, and Framer Motion and CSS for animations. Checkout out the <a href='https://reactjs.org/' className='buttonLink' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Github repo</a> for more info.</p>

        <p>There are so many options for building websites nowadays, but in my personal opinion I like the balance between speed, developer experience, and static/dynamic rendering that Next.js offers. It allows you to get started on your project much faster than cobbling together dozens of plugins to get your environment set up.</p>

        <p>In terms of CSS-in-JS, I tend to go for a solution like Emotion. Although I like the familiar syntax of Styled Components, I prefer the scoping and naming conventions of Emotion.</p>

        <p>Message me any time to find out more. I love to talk about web technologies!</p>

        <p>The pandemic pushed many more businesses online, and I think the Shopify platform has the most momentum, name recognition, and long-term potential. Itâ€™s an accessible, robust eCommerce platform that offers a lot of features out-of-the-box. </p>

        <p>Shopify also offers the best inventory management experience for users, while the Storefront API offers a great developer experience.</p>

        <p>Shopify's React-based framework called Hydrogen is poised to be an eCommerce game-changer too. There's a lot to like.</p>

      <div>
        <p>I'm a big believer in asynchronous communication when it comes to projects. That's why I like to record video walkthroughs to keep projects moving along. I typically send clients project update videos, which they can watch at their convenience. Then they can comment on the video using timestamps.</p>

        <p>Trello is also a great tool for asynchronous project communication. Everything related to the project is in one place and you can comment on any aspect of the project at any time. </p>

        <p>I like to work on all kinds of web projects!</p>

        <p>In the past I've built plenty of sites in static HTML/CSS/JavaScript and on platforms like WordPress. I try not to confine myself to just one or two solutions. I think each project has an ideal tech stack, and I try to get as close to that ideal solution as possible.</p>

        <p>During the pandemic I realized how much eCommerce was growing, and I saw how quickly Shopify was increasing their market share. That was the rationale behind my recent decision to focus on eCommerce storefronts.</p>
